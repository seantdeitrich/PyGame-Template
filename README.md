# PyGame Template
 A template used for my students to develop PyGames. A collaboration between Doug Bergman, David Renton, and Sean Deitrich.

## Installation
To install the game, download and extract the project to any location you prefer. Install Python3 and then run:

```pip3 install pygame-ce```

Then, in Visual Studio Code install the Python extension and run MyAwesomeGame.py. Alternatively, on the command line type

```python3 myAwesomeGame.py```
